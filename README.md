# neural-networks-digit-recognition

## Project Overview
Digit recognition with neural networks, because sometimes simple classifiers just don’t cut it. This project tackles the real-world headache of reading handwritten numbers from forms and deposit slips, not just for bookstore signup sheets, but for cases where mistakes actually matter (money, account numbers, you name it).

### What’s Actually Happening
Start with the “odd/even checkbox problem” for neural network basics (don’t worry, it’s weirdly useful for getting a handle on how NNs work).

Move up to classifying hand-drawn digits reliably (most of the time, at least).

Written for people who want to go beyond copy-pasting Keras code, here you’ll build networks by hand and later compare them to toolkits.

Along the way, you’ll learn to appreciate why neural networks sometimes fail, sometimes surprise, and occasionally just guess.

### Key Technologies
Python, from-scratch network logic

Keras for comparison (when you just want it to work)

Backpropagation, forward propagation, topology fiddling

Jupyter notebooks for test-driving, plotting, and fixing stuff

### Milestones
Feed Forward — feed_forward.ipynb

Backpropagation — back_propagation.ipynb

Network Topology — network_topology.ipynb

Digit Recognition — digit_recognition.ipynb

Keras — keras.ipynb

### Why Use This?
Want to understand how neural networks work without just gluing together libraries? This is for you.

Adaptable to other kinds of data, not just digits.

Good for learning, experimenting, and getting real about what works and what doesn’t
